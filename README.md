# 📖 Overview

This project is a modern music streaming application inspired by Spotify that combines music playback, social interaction, and real-time communication into one seamless platform.

Users can stream songs, browse albums, chat with other listeners, and see what friends are currently listening to. Administrators can manage songs and albums through a dedicated dashboard while media assets are securely stored on Cloudinary.

The application demonstrates modern full-stack engineering practices including secure authentication, REST APIs, WebSocket communication, cloud storage integration, and scalable application architecture.
